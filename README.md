# SyntheticData

Goal is to train a CNN with synthetic data.
We will train it using GTRSB dataset.

TODO:
- Add more features
- Improve data generation

GOAL:
- Create over 2000 images per each class. The images will be generated with blender taking into account many factors such as luminosity, dimension, perspective among others.
- Train the model and test.
- Add Grad-CAM++ to the model.
